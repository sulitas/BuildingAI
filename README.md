# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

AI Silvisor

## Summary

Describe briefly in 2-3 sentences what your project is about. About 250 characters is a nice length! 

The AI project is about building AI for personal uses. 
It means that the user will introduce same pieces of information into the database of the AI, in order to make a personality description available. 
Also, it can be given info regarding the specific work of task the the user is supposed to do daily.
The AI will analyse tke daily tasks and will give indications on how to solve them eficiently.


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

The AI will help users to solve efficiently daily tasks.
All the humans have to solve daily task.
My personal motivation is linked to the fact that I have to solve numerous problems every day that involve a lot of research and creative work.
This topic is interesting because will solve daily facing problems and tasks.

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.

* problem 1 - See the daily routine
* problem 2 - See what task need information, research and creative work
* problem 3 - Offer different solutions to the task required
* problem 4 - Give the feedback


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

See the daily routine - AI observing the schedule
See what task need information, research and creative work - AI identifies the situations (environment, time, info) that needs to be solved
AI will ofer different solutions to the task required (writting, reading, programming, market, research etc.)
The user will select what it needs.

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://sulitas.tk/" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```

def main ():
  activities = ['writting', 'reading', 'programming', 'marketing', 'research']

   for i in range(len(activities)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (activities[i], 100.0)) 

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

The data will come from web.
The program will use different links:
[Manatū Hauora Ministry of Health](https://www.health.govt.nz/)
[Simplicable](https://simplicable.com/life/activities)
[Elemnts of AI](https://buildingai.elementsofai.com/)
[OECD](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/9789264239012-4-en.pdf?expires=1685538917&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=D14AC88E3478FAC3A7434EB5F5CBE314)

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

The project doesn not take decisions in the name of the users. It just provide different solutions to be choosen of.
Limitations - The abuse of useres to other users.

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you need to move on? 

The project could grow if it used by a lot of persons that see the potential of it.
The project could became the AI personal assistant.
To move the project on I need more advanced language programming skills, a team of specialists and enthusiastics and, of course, money.
