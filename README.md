# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course - AI Silvișor

## Summary

The AI project is about building AI for personal uses. <br>
It means that the user will introduce same pieces of information into the database of the AI, in order to make a personality description available. <br>
Also, it can be given info regarding the specific work of task the the user is supposed to do daily.<br>
The AI will analyse tke daily tasks and will give indications on how to solve them eficiently.<br>


## Background

The AI will help users to solve efficiently daily tasks.<br>
All the humans have to solve daily task.<br>
My personal motivation is linked to the fact that I have to solve numerous problems every day that involve a lot of research and creative work.<br>
This topic is interesting because will solve daily facing problems and tasks.<br>

* problem 1 - See the daily routine
* problem 2 - See what task need information, research and creative work
* problem 3 - Offer different solutions to the task required
* problem 4 - Give the feedback


## How is it used?

See the daily routine - AI observing the schedule <br>
See what task need information, research and creative work <br>
AI identifies the situations (environment, time, info) that needs to be solved <br>
AI will ofer different solutions to the task required (writting, reading, programming, market, research etc.) <br>
The user will select what it needs. <br>

The code for AI <br>

def main ():
  activities = ['writting', 'reading', 'programming', 'marketing', 'research']

   for i in range(len(activities)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (activities[i], 100.0)) 

## Data sources and AI methods

The data will come from web.<br>
The program will use different links:<br>
[Manatū Hauora Ministry of Health](https://www.health.govt.nz/) <br>
[Simplicable](https://simplicable.com/life/activities) <br>
[Elemnts of AI](https://buildingai.elementsofai.com/) <br>
[OECD](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/9789264239012-4-en.pdf?expires=1685538917&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=D14AC88E3478FAC3A7434EB5F5CBE314) <br>

## Challenges

The project does not take decisions in the name of the users. It just provide different solutions to be choosen of.<br>
Limitations - The abuse of useres to other users.<br>

## What next?

The project could grow if it used by a lot of persons that see the potential of it.<br>
The project could became the AI personal assistant.<br>
To move the project on I need more advanced language programming skills, a team of specialists and enthusiastics and, of course, money.<br>
